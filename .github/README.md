### - Disclamer -
We do not own **Super Mario** and this is a fan project.

**All Rights of Super Mario** and it's associated franchise **belong to Nintendo**.

**We do not** claim the rights of Nintendo's property and **this is clearly fanmade**.

This project **was created for fun** and was created to fulfill a weird dream ELedlow had.
